*My favorite note-taking method for this material* - Enmanuel üëç

How It Works
---
Outline notes follow a hierarchical structure that in many ways mirrors semantic HTML and even this markdown file.

Outline notes start with big topics, or categories that will encapsulate more precise ideas. Think of these as our top level headers, `h1` tags. We will add sections at different levels, whether it be with indentations or headers (`h2`, `h3`), that are described *generally* by the levels above it and get more specific as we move inside.

Let us take a look at some DOM notes:
```txt
The DOM (Document Object Model) // your topic
---
## Key Methods // 2nd level topic
    ### Finding Elements // 3rd level topic
    + `Document.querySelector()`: info

    ## Creating Elements
    + `Document.createElement()`: info
        - input is tag name as a strig // notes specific to this
```

Pros and Cons
---
**Pros:** This method gives you an easy way to quickly find what you're looking for. It's also incredible easy to write on both a text editor and ruled paper. Paper or digitally, you will find categories and subcategories super helpful in ourganizing your ideas.

**Cons:** Apparantly it's not good if you have to write a lot of equations, I wouldn't know. What I can say is that you might find yourself changing the order of some things and rewriting topic names. It never ends but the document only becomes easier to reference in the future.

**Extras:** If you do this in markdown, you will notice your notes might mirror the markdown of our lesson homepage. This is good. The lesson was structured a certain way for a reason, if it helps to break it down similarly, don't let anyone stop you. Just make sure you're still personalizing it!
